            <p>In Carriage and Insurance Paid To (CIP), the seller assumes all risk until the goods are delivered to the first carrier at the place of shipment - not the place of destination. Once the goods are delivered to the first carrier, the buyer is responsible for all risks.</p>

            <p>However, the seller is responsible for the cost of carriage as well as all-risk insurance coverage until the freight reaches the named place of destination.</p>

            <p>A carrier is any person or company who undertakes the carriage of goods, such as a shipping line, airline, trucking company, railway or freight forwarder.</p>

            <p>In multimodal shipments, the place of shipment is the first carrier used.</p>
